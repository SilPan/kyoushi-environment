  description: >-
    This rule simply matches all DNS queries and answers that end with the
    sub domain used in the dnsteal exfiltration. Now this rule only works
    if we assume that users will not query our malicious sub-domain which is
    a reasonable assumption, if the testbed scenario includes a simulated
    SOC or some other response team then would have to do some more filtering.
    For example we could use sequence queries to match requests to dnsteal server
    log lines or do negative matches with the simulated user logs.
  index:
    - dnsmasq-inet-firewall
  query:
    bool:
      # match answer or question field
      should:
        {# use replace as a poormans regex_escape filter #}
        - regexp:
            dns.answers.name: '.*\.{{ attacker.dnsteal.domain | replace('.', '\.') }}'
        - regexp:
            dns.question.name: '.*\.{{ attacker.dnsteal.domain | replace('.', '\.') }}'

    This rule applies the dnsteal received label to all dnsteal marked
    log lines that occurred while the dnsteal server was active.

  labels: [dnsteal-dropped]
  description: >-
    This rule applies the dnsteal dropped label to all dnsteal marked
    log lines that occurred while the dnsteal server was inactive.
    We define this time range to be from the moment dnsteal stopped until
    the exfiltration service stopped.
  index:
    - dnsmasq-inet-firewall
  filter:
    range:
      "@timestamp":
        # dnsteal stop time (note this is matched without equality)
        gt: "{{ attacker.dnsteal.stop }}"
        # exfiltration service stop
        lte: "{{ attacker.exfiltration_service.stop }}"
  # only apply to lines that are marked dnsteal

    match:
      kyoushi_labels.rules: dnsteal.domain.match

  id: dnsteal.domain.dropped-retry
  labels: [dnsteal-dropped]
  description: >-
    This rule applied the dnsteal dropped label to dnsteal marked log lines
    that occurred when both the dnsteal server and the exfiltration script where inactive.
    Specifically we try to correctly label DNS query retries that occurred after the time frame
    considered for the `dnsteal.domain.dropped` rule. Such logs can occur if the system resolver
    retries queries even if the requesting process has already shut down. To make sure that we do not match
    other traffic we use a parent query to first get all remaining logs not labeled as either
    dnsteal received or dnsteal dropped. We then check if we can find a matching identical parent
    request already labeled as dnsteal dropped. If we find such a parent we apply the label.

  index:
    - dnsmasq-inet-firewall
  filter:
    range:
      "@timestamp":
        # exfiltration service stop
        gt: "{{ attacker.exfiltration_service.stop }}"
        # we assume that query retries happen within 3 minutes of the service shutting down
        lte: "{{ (attacker.exfiltration_service.stop | as_datetime) + timedelta(minutes=3) }}"
